# C CPU Scheduling Algorithms

## Overview
This project is a CPU Scheduling Simulator written in C. It implements multiple scheduling algorithms and calculates performance metrics such as CPU utilization, waiting time, response time, and turnaround time.

## Supported Scheduling Algorithms
- First Come First Serve (FCFS)
- Round Robin (RR)
- Shortest Job First (SJF)
- Shortest Remaining Time Next (SRTN)
- Highest Response Ratio Next (HRRN)
- Lottery Scheduling
- Earliest Deadline First (EDF)
- Priority Scheduling

## Features
- Simulates different scheduling algorithms.
- Randomly generates process parameters.
- Provides both preemptive and non-preemptive execution results.
- Allows comparison of multiple scheduling algorithms using the same dataset.

## Installation and Usage
1. Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/RichaP23/c-cpu-scheduling-algorithms.git

2. Compile the code:
gcc scheduler.c -o scheduler

3. Run the program:

## Example Output
The program generates an output showing the performance metrics for different scheduling algorithms.
